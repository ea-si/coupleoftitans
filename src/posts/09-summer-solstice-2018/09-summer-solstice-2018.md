**Home hood**

We are lucky to have a lush forest 15 minutes from the Bratislava city center, closed to the cars thus without traffic. Trees, providing shadow and cool breeze. This is a throwback to solstice of year 2018 and a tribute to Little Carpathians ridge. Hood that created and nurtured my passion for bikes.

We woke up early to catch the sunrise on the hill ridge, just before work.

Road quality can be within central european 'not great, not terrible'. But with new tarmac layers each year brings us new yay, wheee moments on the same route.

You begin climbing easy up through a fresh valley with dense vegetation.

To peek over both sides of the country from the top in warm morning light.

Looking forward to set up a tradition and do the early morning ride on the longest day of the year again in 2019.

Stay hydrated, friends. When you pee a lot, there is no time for drama.
